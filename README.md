# hello-world

Hi everyone! Just learning how to code (at least more than the basic SQL and advanced Excel formulas and VBA I currently use). Been a data analyst for going on 12 years, and I NEED to move out of what my bosses demand I use so I can actually improve.

I am also a photographer and a crafter who hates Florida, and looks forward to the day I can actually experience all the seasons in one year instead of year hell with occassional bouts of tolerable weather.
